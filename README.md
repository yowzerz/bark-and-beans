This is a STATIC  website, meaning it won't run like a typical website. It's for front-end design only.
However there are few buttons and links that you are be able to interact with.
I hope this helps and grant you a high score!

Running Links:
Logo, Home, Food and Drinks, Account, and Cart Icon (menu button for mobile version).

The Login and Register buttons on the account page are directed to homepage; it will just go straight to the homepage whether you put information on the login/register box or not for it doesn't store any information the user inputs.

Click the "All Vegan Sandwich", it will redirect you the "Cart" page of the site.
All the Order Now button will redirect you to Products Page of the site.

I hope this tips help and guide you to understand how to interact with it.
